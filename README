Here it is, the Sausage Cat public source code release.

I want to dedicate this part to thank Luiz Alves, Crickkin, Krug, Hugo, Maikon, Oskar, KIYOSHI, Bacalhau my family and all my friends that worked on the project/tested it.

I also want to thank you for buying (or not) the game!!!

There is one problem: since GameMaker embeds the levels and content of the game inside the executable, I can only open-source the objects and scripts. And I also cannot share the metadata of the object (I guess). The code also does not have the Steam integrations since I cannot share them.

Besides that, the code is easy to understand and you can learn some stuff with it. I really hope you enjoy reading it :)

Sincerely,
Gabriel G. Cunha (lemmtopia)
