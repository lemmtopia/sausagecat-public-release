# sausagecat-public-release
Sausage Cat source code public release.

# Warning
- This will not compile, as it is just a text dump of the code for studying.
- The code was written for the GameMaker engine.

Besides that, the code is easy to understand and you can learn some stuff with it. I really hope you enjoy reading it :)

Sincerely,
Gabriel G. Cunha (lemmtopia)
